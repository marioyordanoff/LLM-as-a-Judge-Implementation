In most cases, COVID-19 causes mild symptoms\\nincluding dry cough, tiredness and fever, though fever may not be a symptom\\nfor some older people. Other mild symptoms include aches and pains, nasal\\ncongestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhoea. Some people become infected\\nbut donâ€™t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people recover from\\nthe disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people\\nwho gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.   \n",
